# Car-Price-Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to use Big Data frameworks (PySpark) to build a model to predict car prices. We implemented mutiple variations of linear regression along with a Random Forest model to determine the best model for predicting car prices.

## Dataset Source
The dataset used was previously publically available on Kaggle and obtained from Kaggle. However, it is no longer available on Kaggle as the username that posted the dataset is no longer active. The dataset is posted in this repo.
